When development is done:

In auth_controller.js, switch back to res.render 'dashboard' instead of 'myDashboard'.

Also, remove temp-style.css from the public CSS folder.


Thoughts about setup / functionality:

New tasks are automatically associated to the one who created them. This may encourage users to only create tasks that are meaningful or useful to them






When a task is marked complete, in order to both create a record of the completed task and allow the task to be repeated, the complete button must either:
 a) copy all the data from the task and create a record of it (storing it where?)
 b) create a new copy of the task, associate it to the user, and mark it complete (which would add a copy of the task in the general list)
 c) Or...
  1)  We can reate a new Model (called... Complete?)
  2)  Complete button:
    a) takes in relevant data from the task and creates a new record in the Complete table
    b) associates the Complete record to the user in... UserComplete
    c) destroys the association in UserTasks
d) Or...
  1) Same as c) above, except there are two buttons: Complete and Delete, and Complete and Save. That way, the user only saves tasks they want a record of, and db space is preserved.
